# FPSCounter

A small library to measure the frame rate of an iOS Application.

You can display the current frames per second in the status bar with a single line. Or if
you'd like more control, you can have your own code notified of FPS changes and display it
as needed.

_Note_: You should only use this for debugging purposes. Especially the status bar overlay
will cause Apple to reject your app when reviewed.


## Usage

The easiest way to use this library is to add a label to the status bar:

    FPSCounter.showInStatusBar(UIApplication.sharedApplication())

This will replace the status bar with a label that shows the current frames per second
the application manages to draw.

You can remove the label any time later:

    FPSCounter.hide()

If you'd like more control on how to display the frames, you can create a private
`FPSCounter` instance and set a delegate

    self.fpsCounter = FPSCounter()
    self.fpsCounter.delegate = self

To retrieve updates you need to start tracking the FPS:

    self.fpsCounter.startTracking()

If necessary you can specify what run loop and run loop mode to use while tracking:

    self.fpsCounter.startTracking(inRunLoop: myRunLoop, mode: UITrackingRunLoopMode)

By default the `NSRunLoop.mainRunLoop()` and `NSRunLoopCommonModes` are used.

When you don't want to receive further updates, you can stop tracking:

    self.fpsCounter.stopTracking()
